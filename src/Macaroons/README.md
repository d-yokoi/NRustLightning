This library is based on https://github.com/JornWildt/Macaroons.Net
Some parts tweaked so that is works well with dotnet core and to avoid third party deps.

The api must be the same with those of original [libmacaroon](https://github.com/rescrv/libmacaroons). It's README is
good place to learn about the general concept.
